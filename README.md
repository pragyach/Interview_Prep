## üîÅ Flashcard Patterns to Review
- [ ] Two Pointers edge cases (sorted vs unsorted)
- [ ] Backtracking base case templates
- [ ] Prefix sum boundaries
- [ ] Graph visited-state bugs
- [ ] Memoization vs Tabulation edge handling
- [ ] Trie insert/search/delete variations

---

## üìå Notes
- Log every question on Leetcode (use lists or tags)
- Create a ‚Äúüß© Weak Areas‚Äù doc
- Use mock reviews for cold-start debug practice
