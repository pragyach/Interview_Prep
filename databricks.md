| **December**               | **Foundation**: Revise core DSA patterns. 40–60 Leetcode (tagged) | Educative Java Multithreading – 60% done          | Chapters 1–4 of *Designing Data-Intensive Apps* | Java OOP, interfaces, generics, functional programming |
| **January**                | **Advanced**: Tackle harder questions & contests. 50+ Leetcode    | Complete Educative course + concurrency in action | Distributed systems principles, scaling, queues | Head First Design Patterns – 6 major patterns          |
| **February** (till \~15th) | **Mock + Polish**: Timed mocks + system design practice           | Review + 1–2 practice problems per week           | 1–2 HLD mock sessions (record + review)         | 1–2 LLD mocks (mock interviews or self-scenarios)      |
)

📘 Detailed Breakdown by Focus Area
1. 💻 Coding (Leetcode)
Target: 100–120 curated problems

Focus: Arrays, Hashing, DP, Graphs, Trees, Sliding Window, Bit Manipulation

Tools: Leetcode, NeetCode 150, Blind 75, Meta/Databricks tags

December: 4–5 per week + review

January: 6–8 per week + mock contests

February: Mocks + previous misses

2. 🔄 Multithreading
Resource: Educative – Java Multithreading for Senior Engineering Interviews

December: Complete 60–70% of the course (core concepts: locks, synchronization, thread pools, futures, semaphores)

January: Apply in small code snippets and review concurrency bugs

February: 1 mock question/week

3. 🏗️ High-Level Design (HLD)
Resource: Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann

December: Ch 1–4 (Data models, Storage, Encoding)

January: Ch 5–7 (Replication, Partitioning, Transactions)

Optional: Grokking the System Design Interview (for patterns)

February: Mock 1–2 full system design problems

4. 🔧 Low-Level Design (LLD)
Resources:

Head First Design Patterns

Java Generics, Lambdas

Practice on platforms like Exponent, Pramp

December: Understand class diagrams, relationships, SOLID

January: 5–6 Design Patterns (Factory, Observer, Strategy, Builder, Decorator, Command)

February: 1–2 full mock design problems (e.g. BookMyShow, Parking Lot, Rate Limiter)

🎯 February Focus (Final 2 Weeks)
Daily 1–2 mock rounds (coding/design)

Weekly:

1 HLD session

1 LLD scenario

1 multithreading problem

Fix weak areas, focus on clear communication and modular code
